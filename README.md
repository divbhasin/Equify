# Equify

Equify is an iOS equalizer app that uses the Harman frequency response curve to EQ a headphone and make the sound as neutral as possible. While sound can be very subjective from person to person, there is a consensus that any headphone whose frequency response curve matches the Harman curve will sound good to almost any ear.
